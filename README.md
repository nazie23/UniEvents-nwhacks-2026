# UniEvents (nwHacks 2026 Project)
## easily discover club events for you!

### what’s the problem with how we currently find events?
- we love going to events at UBC! unfortunately, it’s not always easy to discover the events that are relevant to our interests
- it’s a common experience to discover an event you wanted to go to right after it ended…
- and as people who have been newcomers at some point, we understand the struggle of finding events that would allow us to meet like-minded folks and form long-lasting friendships

### our proposed solution!
- we built UniEvents to create a comprehensive experience when it comes to finding club events
- users will be able to:
  - browse all club events happening on campus in order of recency
  - create a profile used to register for all club events
  - choose interests and be recommended events based on them
  - sign up to a waitlist for an event and be automatically moved when a space is available
- and having experienced organizing club events ourselves, we care about all of our users’ experiences, including those organizing the events
- organizers will be able to use UniEvents to:
  - create posts for events that will be recommended to users based on their interests
  - read analytics about what category of events users are more likely to register for based on past data

### tech stack
TypeScript (React.js), CSS, Supabase

### what do we have planned for the future?
- at the moment, our prototype is implemented with dummy data created for UBC events:
  - once we have a polished and fully implemented prototype (on user and organizer ends), we would like to test our website with AMS clubs
  - our goal is to have all UBC clubs participating in our website
- produce an adjacent mobile app with all the same features as our website
- post-successful launch with UBC, pitch to other universities in BC (SFU, UVic, BCIT)
